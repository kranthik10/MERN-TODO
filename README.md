# TODO IN MERN STACK

This repo consists both the frontend and backend for the todo web application.

If you want to understand the basic application development in MERN stack, you can use this simple web application for starting point.

 - It has all the CRUD operations.
 - In future I would like to add more functionality to this and feel free to contribute if you guys are interested in this project development.
